# Audio Recorder

Hello everyone, this is a simple JavaScript app that will allow you to record your audio. I know there is nothing much in it, but you can refer to this code while building an app that requires audio.

## How to Use It?

You can download the files and store it in any directory you want as long as the HTML, CSS, JS, and the **assets** folder are in the same directory.

You can download the code, use it in your projects without any restrictions.
